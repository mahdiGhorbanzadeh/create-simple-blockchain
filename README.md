Hello. I am embarking on my first experience in blockchain implementation, and I have chosen Bitcoin as the initial platform. As the pioneering blockchain technology, Bitcoin serves as my introduction to this fascinating field.

I first started with this video:

That helped me to understand the system in general. Plus the following link:

https://developer.bitcoin.org/

which is the main reference of Bitcoin itself and has given comprehensive explanations about the Bitcoin system. Based on this link, I started making modifications that were not in the training video, for example, developed bitcoin Header-First system. It was also said in the block production training video that the system should wait until the number of blocks reaches the quorum, which was not true, and I changed it, and changes were made in the block and transaction class.

And one more thing, because I worked with Solidity and NodeJS, I wrote the blockchain in JavaScript, which should be changed to Go in the future.
